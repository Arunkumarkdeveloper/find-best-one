        <h6>Introduction</h6>
        <p>As a freelance web developer, I recently worked on a project that involved Next.js, Next-Auth for
            authentication, and
            Next-Intl for internationalization. While building this project, I encountered some challenges related to
            organizing the
            middleware to work seamlessly with Next-Intl and Next-Auth. In this article, Iâ€™ll share my experience and
            the solutions
            I implemented to streamline the authentication and internationalization process.</p>
        <h6>What is Next.js?</h6>
        <p>Next.js is a powerful React framework that simplifies the creation of server-rendered React applications. It
            offers
            features like server-side rendering (SSR), automatic code splitting, and easy routing, making it an ideal
            choice for
            building modern web applications. Next.js provides a robust foundation for building web apps with enhanced
            performance
            and SEO capabilities.</p>
